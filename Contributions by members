# We have broken down our python codes and made a contributions panel down below. the contributions by both of us is mentioned below 
with our names and the code below our names.(note: we have also uploaded our full code and the python file along side this breakdown 
with all the other files needed to complete the assignment)

#Coding done by Prashanna is below:

import pandas as pd
acs_part1 = pd.read_csv('fairfield.csv',encoding='latin-1')
acs_part1

acs_part2 = pd.read_csv('fairfield_loc.csv',encoding='latin-1')
acs_part2

pd.merge(
    acs_part1, acs_part2,
    left_index=True, right_index=True,
)



import pandas as pd

df=pd.read_csv('Fairfield.csv',encoding='latin-1')


#FINDING MAX AND MIN
p=df['Mercury'].max()
q=df['Mercury'].min()
print(p)
print(q)


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv('fairfield.csv',encoding='latin-1', usecols=['Mercury','Fish','Elevation'])
print(df.describe())
plt.hist(df['Mercury'])



df = pd.read_csv('fairfield.csv',encoding='latin-1', usecols=['Fish'])
print(df.describe())
plt.hist(df['Fish'])
